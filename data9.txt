Get busy living, or get busy dying....

and no good thing ever dies.
These walls are funny. First you hate them, then you get used to them.
Enough time passes,you get so you depend on them.Thats institutionalized.
Stay hungry, stay foolish.
your time is limited so don't waste it living someones else's life.
love what you do else DO WHAT YOU LOVE.
it's not the customer's job to know what they want.
If i try my best and fail ,well i tried my best.
Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.
I want to put a ding in the universe.
