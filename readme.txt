TITLE : GREP COMMAND

MIS : 111508040

DESCRIPTION:
	Grep command searches for pattern in given file.
	./project [OPTION]... PATTERN [FILE]...
	This command contains various options for matching the given pattern e.g -i option searches for pattern case insesitively.For more 		information you can run ./project --help
	In my project you can run only one option at a time(except -w -c -v options which is mentioned in ./project --help)
	However you can give multiple files as input
	In recursive grep , i have changed the way of printing the address of a particular file.All the files which are in the same 		directories are printed on the same level.Sub-directories are printed on a differnt level
	I have only done options which are mentioned in help feature
	If a binary file is given as input then my command does nothing and procceds further
