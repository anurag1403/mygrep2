My code: grep command


Regexp selection and interpretation:
	-i,		ignore case distinctions
	-w,		force PATTERN to match only whole words
	-x,		force PATTERN to match only whole lines
 	-G,		PATTERN is a basic regular expression (BRE)	
Miscellaneous:
	-v,		select non-matching lines
Output control:
	-m NUM,		stop after NUM matches 
	-n,		print line number with output lines
	-o,		show only the part of a line matching PATTERN
	-c,		print only a count of matching lines per FILE
	-r,		like --directories=recurse

combination of above options.
