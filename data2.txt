Happy Diwali to everybody!
do you know why we celebrate diwali?
Diwali is celebrated on occasion of returning of Lord Ram to his home.
Diwali is a festival of joy and happiness.
it is also called as festival of light.
people burn crackers on this occasion as a token of victory.
Actually this ritual should stop as firing crackers causes air pollution. 
hence we should start celebrating eco-friendly diwali.
by doing so we can save our mother earth.
THANK YOU!
